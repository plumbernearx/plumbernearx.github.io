<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly regenerated. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Tough water causes gray or white deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
<p>The most convenient method to remove the solidity is by filtering your water through a water softener.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
