These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
