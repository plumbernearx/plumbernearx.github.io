We've currently seen what these two terms have in common, so what's the distinction between them? When it comes to the concern of tough water, a conventional water softener really removes magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is called short-lived solidity". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
