<p>Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound. A recommendation: most homeowner insurance companies will pay to repair a water leak and water damage to your house twice. But if it happens a 3rd time, you run the risk of having your insurance provider drop you. To begin with, any Sarasota County homeowner who has a watering system or a well is required to install a backflow preventer at the water meter (because both systems are at threat of contamination due to backflow).</p>

If it clogs again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!
