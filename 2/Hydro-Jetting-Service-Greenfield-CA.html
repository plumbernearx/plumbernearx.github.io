Assess the sewer lines from property to curb connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to completely check if pipe damage, deterioration, or significant obstructions are present. Tree roots are among the most significant reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots enter into the drain line they can trigger clogs and back up into your house.</p>
