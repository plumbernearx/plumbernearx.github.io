If pushing down on the flapper stops the sound, the flapper isn't sealing under normal pressure. Switch off the water, flush the toilet to empty the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. Clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad if you feel mineral deposits. Don't use anything that might roughen it. You need to replace the flapper if cleaning the flush valve seat does not solve the issue.</p>
