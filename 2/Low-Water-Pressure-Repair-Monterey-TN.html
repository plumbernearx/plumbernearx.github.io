<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when freshly restored. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated up, hard water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
