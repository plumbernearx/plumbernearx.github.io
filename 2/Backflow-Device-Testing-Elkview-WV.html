A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hindering water flow. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to land fills and other disposing locations. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through currently existing water facilities.</p>

<p>Where the company is located: Beware of contractors who offer you a post workplace box without any street address or use only an answering service.

Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check avoids backflow caused by pressure increases in the down stream plumbing.</p>
