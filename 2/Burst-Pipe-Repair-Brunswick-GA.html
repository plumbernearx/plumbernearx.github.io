<p>Master plumber: To become a master plumber, an individual must have a particular variety of years' experience as a journeyman plumber, in addition to an associate's degree or training at a trade school. A master plumber must pass an exam that usually encompasses both composed and practical knowledge. They must also finish continuing education hours every year. Usually the business owner, a master plumber goes through inspection and needs to ensure all journeyman plumbers working for his/her company are in compliance with plumbing regulations.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
