<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance.

If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
