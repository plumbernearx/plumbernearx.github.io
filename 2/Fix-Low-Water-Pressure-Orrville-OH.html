<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
