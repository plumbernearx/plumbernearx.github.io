Clogged drains can quickly end up being significant concerns if not managed effectively. Call us today at (303) 758-6237 for quickly, accurate service in Denver and the surrounding locations. We've already seen what these two terms have in common, so what's the difference between them? When it concerns the problem of tough water, a conventional water softener really gets rid of calcium, magnesium and silica ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is called temporary hardness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
