<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the technique laid out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
