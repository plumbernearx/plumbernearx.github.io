<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decline in provided pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down lead to a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
