<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
