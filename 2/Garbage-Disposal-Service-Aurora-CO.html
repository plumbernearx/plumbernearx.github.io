Garden hoses that are utilized to apply chemical fertilizers or pesticides are likewise vulnerable to drawing contaminants into your home. If your house was built after 1985, it must be equipped with backflow-preventing hose bibs. If your house is older, you need to check to ensure you have the appropriate security for outside faucets.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the system falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
