<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Low Water Pressure - Low water pressure is the top concern with many homes and business' alike. Simply said it's tough to get casserole dishes or any large serving piece clean with no pressure in the faucet or sprayer. Mineral deposits are also a major culprit, clogs from food bits, clogs in aerator screens all certainly stop water circulation. The most severe could be water leaking, blocked lines to the cut off, or even worse a frozen pipe entering the house or building.</p>
