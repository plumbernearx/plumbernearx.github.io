<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet efficiency- The greater the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The efficiency of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.
