Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be evaluated occasionally to ensure they are working properly. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers need to be evaluated with properly calibrated gauge devices.</p>

Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
