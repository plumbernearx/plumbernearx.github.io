A good guideline for hot water heater is this: because the life expectancy of the typical hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point.

I am so impressed with this company. They responded to a hot water heater concern at my service within 30 minutes of me calling. I would suggest Marin WATER for any plumbing concern.

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to get away. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down lead to a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
