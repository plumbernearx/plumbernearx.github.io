<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project.
