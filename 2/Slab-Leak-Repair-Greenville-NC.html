<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project.

<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system as the result of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure.

Garbage disposal guarantees last an average of 5 years, however they can range between 2 and 10 years. Considering that the typical life expectancy of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may want to buy an extended warranty.
