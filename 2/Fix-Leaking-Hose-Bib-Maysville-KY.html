<p>Backflow preventers are critical for creating a safe water system system. A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, accumulated food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
