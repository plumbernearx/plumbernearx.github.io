Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get an estimate from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement.

All of them wanted to take a look at the circumstance before committing to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
