<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
