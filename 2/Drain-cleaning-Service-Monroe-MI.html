<p>As water heaters age, particularly when they approach the decade mark, you may begin to discover some concerns. Any types of unusual noises generally recommend difficulty. Popping noises, for example, show that the water is boiling (which must never ever take place). Sediment build-up or a defective thermostat represent typical factors for boiling water.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at expected operational pressure to flow through. Should backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
