<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Brooklyn NY</h3>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
