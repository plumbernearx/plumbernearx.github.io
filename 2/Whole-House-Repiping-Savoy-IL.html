<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Savoy IL</h3>

Doing a toilet repair yourself can be tricky if you aren't well versed in plumbing repair, so we suggest you leave it to Ryan's Plumbing to get your toilet working rapidly again.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
