<p>Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain pathway, little pipes run from the tub and sink to ultimately meet up with a larger one underneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house. A great method to reduce the quantity of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal. Quickly and efficiently getting rid of remaining potato peels, fruit rinds and many other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds everything into fine particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into your house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
<p>Leakages-- The disposal might leak into the cabinet area below the sink, resulting in possible water damage and other problems. Energy cost savings. They drastically decrease your water heating costs due to the fact that there is no tank" of water for the unit to constantly heat and re-heat all day.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
