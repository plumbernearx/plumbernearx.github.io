<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to destroy micro-organisms and provide purified water. The energy source needed to heat up the water is cheaper. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water firmness can be gotten rid of relatively easily by using an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations describe positively charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water passes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
