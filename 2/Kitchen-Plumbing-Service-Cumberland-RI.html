<p>Make certain to consult your local authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) on the specific backflow prevention requirements for your area, tenancy, and system type. Your hot water heater is dead when the tank leakages. The telltale sign that your water heater needs changing is a slow drip below, typically showing up as a path of rusty water. This means that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be fixed. Other symptoms, such as inadequate or no hot water, usually signal other water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>

When the pipes begin to rust, it impacts your supply of water. Infected water is a health hazard and should be dealt with quickly. Rust can also split, break, or burst pipes and destroy your walls or floorings.

Your home will run more effectively, your month-to-month energy costs will remain low, and you won't need to spend additional money for pricey and unforeseen repairs.</p>
