<p>Require backflow prevention assemblies and assemblies within a property as detailed in the state required plumbing codes. The water suppliers normally do not have the capability to repeatedly check every consumer's properties for cross-connections and backflow protection. Typically, this would consist of the water service connection to each committed fire security system or irrigation piping system and the water service connection to each of the following types of properties: (1) facilities with an auxiliary or reclaimed water system; (2) commercial, medical, laboratory, other or marine facilities where objectionable substances are managed in a manner that might trigger pollution or contamination of the general public water supply; (3) facilities exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and facilities where an internal backflow prevention assembly needed under the State Plumbing Code is not effectively installed or kept; (4) classified or limited facilities; and (5) high buildings.</p>
