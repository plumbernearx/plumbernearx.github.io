<p>The garbage disposal is an extremely hassle-free function, however it's something that shouldn't be neglected in terms of care and maintenance. Lots of people do not treat their garbage disposals properly, which can lead to all kinds of issues. This, in turn, can not just lead to the waste disposal unit no longer running effectively or effectively, but can likewise lead to concerns with other components and plumbing units.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
