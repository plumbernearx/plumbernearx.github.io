Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
