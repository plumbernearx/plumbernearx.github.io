Sometimes, whole-house repiping might be needed to replace all the pipes in your house.</p>
<p>To link a power cable to the new system, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you water with safe and clean water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection.

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated yearly. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated annually to guarantee the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
