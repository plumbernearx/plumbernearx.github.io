<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its normal flow. IRWD's drinkable water system is developed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply differ "regular," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water going into the safe and clean water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic product, which means germs will not grow on it. Copper has been utilized (along with PVC pipes) considering that the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old structures. It is especially helpful for cold and hot faucet water and refrigerant lines in A/C systems.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
