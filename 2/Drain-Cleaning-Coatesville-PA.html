Mechanical gauges used to determine test pressures shall have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure.

Where the gauge does not suggest the minimum pressure needed for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as indicated by pressure gauges during inspection shall be deemed to show the presence of a leak.</p>
