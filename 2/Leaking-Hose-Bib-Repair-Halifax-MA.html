The effectiveness of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
