This is especially real when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
