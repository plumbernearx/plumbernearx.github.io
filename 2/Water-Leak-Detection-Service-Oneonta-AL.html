It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee. This is especially real when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
