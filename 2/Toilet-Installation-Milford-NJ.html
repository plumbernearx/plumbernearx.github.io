<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
