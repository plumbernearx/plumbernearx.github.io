<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin.

The large amount of time, cash, and energy needed to clean up the detrimental adverse effects of difficult water is dizzying. An entire house water softener is the service to the scourge of water hardness.</p>
