<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. Then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in several drains at as soon as in your house. This can take place in numerous areas and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine.

<p>No hot water - The most obvious indicator that your water heater is malfunctioning is an absence of warm water originating from the tap.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
