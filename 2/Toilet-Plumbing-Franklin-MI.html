The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to escape. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down lead to a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
