<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
