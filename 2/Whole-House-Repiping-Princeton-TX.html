<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of quality kitchen sinks to choose from. For example, many consumers choose stainless steel undermount sinks since they can take quite a bit of abuse throughout the years. Enameled cast iron sinks are also back in favor, and they come in a large range of designs. You also need to choose about whether to have a single or multi-bowl  sink. The size of the bowl as well as additional choices regarding the faucet are all aspects of the process that we can assist you with.</p>
