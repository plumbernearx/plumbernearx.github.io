<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
