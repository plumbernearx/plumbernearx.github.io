<p>Watering backflow devices are developed for installation on potable water lines to protect against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of contaminated water into the drinkable water supply. While there's not an exact timetable regarding when you should repipe your home, you must definitely look into repiping if they haven't been done in 50 years or more-- especially if you reside in an older house constructed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain what exactly was wrong with the unit, how he fixed the problem, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would extremely recommend Hunter for any problems you may have.</p>
