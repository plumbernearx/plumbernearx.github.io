<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Plymouth PA</h3>

Call (866) 701-5306 to arrange an appointment. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically defined by water purveyors.  It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.
