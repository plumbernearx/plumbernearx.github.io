<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to business? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water really requires it. When required, more recent systems use electronic sensors that monitor bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water use and therefore only restore. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
