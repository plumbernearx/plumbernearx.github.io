<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Hayden AL</h3>

An approved, effectively set up and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the difference is inadequate to make any significant modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
