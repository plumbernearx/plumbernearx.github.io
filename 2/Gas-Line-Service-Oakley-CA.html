<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Oakley CA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A leaking toilet is another typical issue homeowners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than most likely methods your toilet has a leak. This problem is frequently triggered by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as simple as a worn flapper valve. A drip pan is affordable and efficient. The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous dripping water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into an appropriate drain. A perfect time to replace or install a drip pan is when the water heater is being replaced.</p>
