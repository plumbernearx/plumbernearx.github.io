<p>The nationwide typical cost to repair a dripping faucet is $65-$ 150, but the cost may be higher, depending on the nature and reason for the leak.

<p>Lubrication may aid with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any much better, it is just there to assist the specialist put together the elements into the body without creating damage from friction. The lube needs to be a food grade lubricant to assure the water system is not contaminated. In most cases the best lube is water. The usual usage for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be lightly oiled to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer. Using excessive lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or use out faster by attracting dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the component.
