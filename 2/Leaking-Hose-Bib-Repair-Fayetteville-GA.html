To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
