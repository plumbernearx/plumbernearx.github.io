<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Hummelstown PA</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>The Relief Valve is operating properly, but the # 1 Check Valve is not, due to the debris or damage preventing the complete closure of the Check. Depending on the quantity of debris or damage, the Relief Valve can release just a slight drip or can open totally, streaming water up until the shut-off valves are closed.
