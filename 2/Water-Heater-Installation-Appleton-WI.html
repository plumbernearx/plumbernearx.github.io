<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this brief section of pipe before it can reach the water heater's control valve. The needed length of the drip leg varies. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need fewer repairs over time. If you see your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are lacking warm water really quickly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a hot water heater inspection. The California Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) needs licensed plumbers to restore their license every 2 years.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's become problematic, or just for a makeover? How about for a building addition or significant remodel? When again, that's something you might do yourself, although it's usually better to employ a knowledgeable sink plumber in the San Diego area.

It can be difficult matching up cut outs and fixture holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with everything sealed up.</p>

Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get an estimate from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would offer a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the circumstance before committing to a cost, and all wished to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
