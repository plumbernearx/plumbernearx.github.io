<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that should also be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to split and harden or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything remains in good shape.</p>
