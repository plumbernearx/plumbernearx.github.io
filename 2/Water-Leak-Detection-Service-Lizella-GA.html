I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
