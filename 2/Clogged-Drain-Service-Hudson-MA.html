<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created due to the fact that of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
