<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they usually occur in the lowest open drain. This type of problem is usually the result of a clog in the line. If you do not detect the odor coming from the sewer backup, you might determine this issue due to the fact that a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink.
