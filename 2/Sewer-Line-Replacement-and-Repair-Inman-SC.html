<p>In addition to the specific centers listed above, an approved backflow prevention assembly must be set up on each drinkable water service connection to any properties containing a real or possible  hazard. Noted listed below are examples of dangers and the minimum defense required to be installed for each type of threat. The minimum approved backflow prevention assembly for unlisted hazards will be figured out on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>
