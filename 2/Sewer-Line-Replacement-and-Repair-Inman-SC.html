<p>In addition to the specific centers listed above, an approved backflow prevention assembly must be set up on each drinkable water service connection to any properties containing a real or possible  hazard. Noted listed below are examples of dangers and the minimum defense required to be installed for each type of threat.

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force.

That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>
