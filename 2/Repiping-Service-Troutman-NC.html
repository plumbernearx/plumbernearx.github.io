<p>If your polybutylene pipes have stopped working, read your insurance coverage thoroughly. Ensure you know what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be denied due to the fact that the standard HO-3 property owners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged period of time." Call your insurance coverage agent and confirm your coverage. Once you have reviewed your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to verify that your understanding is right.</p>
