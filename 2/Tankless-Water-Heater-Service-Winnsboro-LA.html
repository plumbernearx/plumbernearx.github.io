<p>A new hot water heater will likely last longer, give you less problems, and cost you less to run gradually.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and harden or merely be so squished that it does not fill the area along with it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything is in good shape.</p>
