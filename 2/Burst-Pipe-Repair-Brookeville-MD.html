<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted brine solution after the regeneration cycle.

Completion of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air space may be utilized to achieve this, and may be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>
