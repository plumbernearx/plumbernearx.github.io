<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is specifically real when the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
