I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel.

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regeneration depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water actually needs it. Newer systems utilize computerized sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other key metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only restore when required.
