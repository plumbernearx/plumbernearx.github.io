<p>Getting rid of or decreasing water firmness is done with a tool known as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange procedure happens. A softener is comprised of various elements, each having their own unique purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel typically built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is typically described. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most standard type has an electric timer that flushes and recharges the system on a routine schedule.</p>
