<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Stoughton WI</h3>
<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these guidelines for an offered application and which are worn out or broken and require replacement needs to be replaced by a backflow preventer which does comply to the rules for the given application.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
