This is especially true when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
