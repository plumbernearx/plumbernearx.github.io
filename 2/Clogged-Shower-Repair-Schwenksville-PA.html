Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.)

For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines because pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>
