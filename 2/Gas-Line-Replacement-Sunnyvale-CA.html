<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall.

Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many home centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
