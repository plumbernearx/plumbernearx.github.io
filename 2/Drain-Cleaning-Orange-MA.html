<p>Despite the Romans' typical usage of lead pipes, their aqueducts seldom poisoned people. Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had so much calcium in it that a layer of plaque avoided the water getting in touch with the lead itself. What often causes confusion is the big amount of evidence of widespread lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had simple access to piped water, 19 an unfortunate result of lead being utilized in pots and pans and as an additive to processed food and beverage (for example as a preservative in red wine). 20 Roman lead pipe inscriptions offered info on the owner to avoid water theft.</p>

Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank.
