In most cases, a lack of warm water is triggered by a defective circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank might be cracked if the water is lukewarm.

<p>A couple of local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any area where it might ever be immersed under water. Some municipalities do not enable the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some do not permit the use of a PVB at all, so check with your water company.
