<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. A garbage disposal fixes all of those problems, including convenience. Merely switch on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and far more quietly than you believe.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
