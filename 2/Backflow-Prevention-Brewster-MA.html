<p>Camera are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing business. A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>One sure indication that you may need a gas line repair is if there is an actually strong, rotten egg-like odor that you just can't identify, it may be time to contact Mr. Rooter Plumbing.

In such a case, it is really essential to call specialists instantly. Likewise, devices that use a gas such as ovens and hot water heater might have indications of corrosion where they link to the gas line. These are very important signs that need to not be disregarded. Mr. Rooter Plumbing in Atlanta is happy to offer licensed and skilled plumbers to investigate your particular case and guide you in your next actions. In the event that your gas line can not be repaired, it might be time for a gas line replacement.</p>
