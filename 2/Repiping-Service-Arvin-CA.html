<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is required to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its style and absence of moving parts. However, it may be impractical in many circumstances to install a pipe section of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
