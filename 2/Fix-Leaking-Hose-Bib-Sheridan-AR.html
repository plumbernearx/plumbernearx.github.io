Prior to salt begins working in a water softener it needs a little residence time within the tank, given that the salt is liquifying slowly. When one immediately starts regeneration after including salt to the reservoir, the water softener may not work according to requirements. After an approval of strategies has been issued and the assembly has been installed, it needs to be checked by a certified tester. The designer (or water provider) is then accountable to accredit that the installation was done in accordance with approved strategies; or explain any modifications or submit "As Constructed" plans as appropriate.</p>
