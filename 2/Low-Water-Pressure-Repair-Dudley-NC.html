<p>Leakages are sneaky. While the time needed will vary based upon the house size and the number of discovered malfunctions, it's best to reserve as much as 2 hours when you schedule an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely rushed the job (unless you have a really little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to schedule your visit.</p>
