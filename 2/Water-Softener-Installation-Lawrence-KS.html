While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself.

These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is commonly described. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most fundamental type has an electrical timer that recharges the system and flushes on a routine schedule.</p>
