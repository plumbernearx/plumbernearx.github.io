<p>The term tough water" might seem like an oxymoron, but it's merely household water that contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to consume. They also are fairly undetected through odor or taste, however they can be harmful just the exact same. Just like our trenchless services, we will first conduct pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Where the company lies: Be cautious of contractors who provide you a post office box with no street address or usage only an answering service.
