Replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be suitable if health or ecological reasons require limiting sodium. Gradually, the beads become coated with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has 3 cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regeneration procedure can be set up immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>This ion exchange procedure is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another mix that can work on sink obstructions.
