<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
