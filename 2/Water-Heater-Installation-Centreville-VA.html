The test period shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will stand up to the test pressure defined without showing any proof of leak or other problems. Mechanical assesses used to measure test pressures shall have a variety such that the greatest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as shown by pressure assesses throughout inspection will be considered to show the presence of a leak.</p>
