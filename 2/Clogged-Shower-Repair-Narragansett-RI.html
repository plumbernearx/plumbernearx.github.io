If it was built prior to 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will begin to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't already). And if your house was constructed prior to World War II, then it probably requires replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>
