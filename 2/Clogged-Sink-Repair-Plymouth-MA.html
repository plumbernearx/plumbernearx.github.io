<p>This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless-steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for several years to come. Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water features are considered a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be shown on construction plans.

<p>It's a good concept to test your backflow assembly every spring when you turn your watering system on. Nevertheless, we rarely suggest CPVC when a whole house needs repiping.

Mechanical assesses utilized to measure test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not greater than 5 times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will require a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out utilizing a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as suggested by pressure evaluates during inspection will be considered to indicate the existence of a leak.</p>
