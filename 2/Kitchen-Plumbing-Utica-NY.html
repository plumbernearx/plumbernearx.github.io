<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to escape. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
