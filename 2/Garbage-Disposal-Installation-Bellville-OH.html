<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>

It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
