<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
