<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper.

This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
