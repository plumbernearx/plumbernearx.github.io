<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply.
