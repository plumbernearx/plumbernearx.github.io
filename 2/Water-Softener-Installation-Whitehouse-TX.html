It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
