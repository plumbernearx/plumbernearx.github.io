<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Lakewood OH</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
