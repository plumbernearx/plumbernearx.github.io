<p>Run the hot water. Hot water is your friend, especially for your kitchen sink. Even if you are really mindful with what you put down your sinks, food remnants and cooking oils still escape down our drains - specifically the kitchen sink.

If you've ever observed that the busier your business is, the much better your detergent works, the offender could be an oversized softener.</p>

If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.
