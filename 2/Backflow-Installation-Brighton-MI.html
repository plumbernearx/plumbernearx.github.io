Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave.
