<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
