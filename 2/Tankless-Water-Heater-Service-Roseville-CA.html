<p>The garbage disposal is humming, but not turning. The waste disposal unit has ended up being jammed. IF IT IS JAMMED, NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL. Even if the unit is off, the blades are sharp and hazardous. Make certain the unit is off, you can even shut off the breaker to make sure it can't be turned on by mishap. Your waste disposal unit includes a. hex wrench that can be utilized to place into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. If you can't locate this wrench, then attempt to insert a broom handle or plunger into the sink drain opening and try to turn the jammed flywheel. If it appears to be moving freely turn the unit back on (and do not forget to turn back on the circuit breaker if you don't it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I enjoy to prepare, I create a whole lot of dishes. We set up a momentary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we understood that we needed the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within thirty minutes and he guarantees that the sink will remain clog-free for one month. If it clogs again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are very pleased that we selected Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will absolutely utilize this company once again and once again in the future.</p>
