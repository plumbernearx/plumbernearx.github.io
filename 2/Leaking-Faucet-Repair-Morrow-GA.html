<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Decreasing or removing water solidity is done with a piece of equipment called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange procedure takes place. A softener is comprised of various parts, each having their own unique purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is frequently referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electric timer that recharges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>
