<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its regular circulation. IRWD's drinkable water system is designed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "regular," the direction of water flow can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the potential for infected water entering the safe and clean water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic material, which means bacteria will not grow on it. Copper has actually been used (along with PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old structures. It is particularly beneficial for cold and hot faucet water and refrigerant lines in HEATING AND COOLING systems.</p>

<p>An rdc resembles a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer including two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it normally does not include shutoff valves, might or may not be geared up with test cocks or ports, and is generally less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but should be used to separate only nonhealth risks and is planned for usage only in water service connections to single-family homes.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the very first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. An RPBA is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be utilized to separate health or non-health threats.</p>
