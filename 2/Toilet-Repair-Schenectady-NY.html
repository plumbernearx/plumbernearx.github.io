I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
