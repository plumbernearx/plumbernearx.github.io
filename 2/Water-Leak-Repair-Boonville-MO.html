<p>Make certain to contact your local authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) on the precise backflow prevention requirements for your system, tenancy, and area type. Your water heater is dead when the tank leaks. The indication that your hot water heater requires replacing is a slow drip underneath, generally showing up as a trail of rusty water.

<p>Once the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>

The backflow preventer you select need to be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
