<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home."

The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses. As you home ages the water traveling through your pipes collects more sediment. This is why repiping your home makes good sense.
