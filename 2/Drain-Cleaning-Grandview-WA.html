Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water system within a structure these gadgets are called seclusion" BFP.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>

<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned). Salt is typically used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
