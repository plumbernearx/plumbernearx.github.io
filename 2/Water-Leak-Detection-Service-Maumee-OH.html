<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
