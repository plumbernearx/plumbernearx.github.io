<p>Lubrication may aid with the placement of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the specialist assemble the elements into the body without producing damage from friction. The lube needs to be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water supply is not contaminated. In many cases the very best lube is water. The normal use for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be lightly lubricated to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of excessive lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to use or stop working out faster by attracting dirt and debris or restricting the motion of the part. The appropriate quantity of lube ought to make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You ought to never ever see portions or globs of lubricant.</p>

After a preliminary inspection and testing of a newly installed backflow preventer, the water customer is required to have the backflow preventer checked on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
