<p>A leaking toilet is another common issue house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than most likely means your toilet has a leak.

The drip pan is set up under the hot water heater in order to collect any extraneous dripping water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into an appropriate drain. A perfect time to install a drip or replace pan is when the water heater is being replaced.</p>
