<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. When your existing installed immediate hot water system needs replacement, Bonney's experienced plumbers can replace your instant hot water dispenser or immediate warm water heater tank quickly and economically. Garbage disposal units are set up under the kitchen sink. Setting up one requires working with electrical and plumbing connections, so you need a licensed plumber to handle the task. Some waste disposal unit need to connect with dishwashers as well. All of them must be connected to the p-trap.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
