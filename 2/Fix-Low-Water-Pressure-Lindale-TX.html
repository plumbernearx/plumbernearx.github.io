<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
