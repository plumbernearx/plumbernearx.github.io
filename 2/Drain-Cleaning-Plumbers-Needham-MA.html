<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your home.

<p>For the purpose of water treatment, hardness is measured in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is defined as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one US gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is specified as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To transform between gpg and ppm use the list below element; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm. Furthermore, milligrams per litre is equivalent to parts per million and can be used synonymously.</p>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
