<p>As pointed out, clogged or blocked drains and pipes can cause damage to your house.

The test will hold for a minimum of 15 minutes without leaks. 2. DO toss a couple of lemon or orange peels into your disposal from time to time to help it operate properly - and to make your kitchen odor fresh and clean.</p>
<p>Unsure whether or not you have a backflow prevention device set up? Normally, it's set up near your culinary stop and waste.
