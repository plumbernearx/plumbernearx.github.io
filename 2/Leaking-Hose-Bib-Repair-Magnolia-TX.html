The lubricant should be a food grade lube to ensure the water supply is not infected. In most cases the best lubricant is water. The usual use for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be gently lubed to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out quicker by bring in dirt and debris or restricting the motion of the element. The proper quantity of lubricant need to make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You need to never see portions or globs of lubricant.</p>
