Scalding water is generally the result of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and must be instantly dealt with by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
