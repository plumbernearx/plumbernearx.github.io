<p>When the information gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually broken down in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers must only be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
