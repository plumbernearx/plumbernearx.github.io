So conserve yourself some major difficulty by being sincere with yourself about where your experience level is. The majority of backflow preventers are designed to permit the elements to be eliminated for repair while the main body remains installed in the piping system.

Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
