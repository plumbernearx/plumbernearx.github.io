<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Where the company lies: Beware of contractors who give you a post workplace box without any street address or usage only an answering service. Never work with someone who comes unsolicited to your door and can't offer you proof of certifications-- specifically if she or he pressures you to hire quick and pay money in advance. Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Inspect prevents backflow caused by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing.</p>
