<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its many desired uses around your home.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 on average depending on the length from the main gas line.

You could have an issue with high water pressure if your water heater stops working due to sediment build up in the tank. The water pressure builds and may ultimately cause the tank to blow up.
