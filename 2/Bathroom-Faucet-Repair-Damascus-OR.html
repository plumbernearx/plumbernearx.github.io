<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later use when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
