When the tank leaks, your water heater is dead. The telltale sign that your water heater requires changing is a slow drip below, typically appearing as a trail of rusty water. This suggests that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be fixed. Other signs, such as inadequate or no hot water, generally signal other water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>

Auto-reverse setting: Some waste disposal unit come with this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This secures the blades so they do not wear out as quickly. All leakages, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>
