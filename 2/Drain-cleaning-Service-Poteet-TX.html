<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we show, examine the directions.

Water will release up until the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
