<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
