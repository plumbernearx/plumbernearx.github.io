<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>

Assemblies not presently noted should have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
