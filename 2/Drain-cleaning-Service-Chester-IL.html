<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regeneration depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water actually needs it. Newer units use electronic sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based upon your water usage and therefore just restore when required. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
