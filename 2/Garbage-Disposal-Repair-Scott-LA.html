<p>For starters it will most likely have trouble staying up to date with the flow of water and will start to flood the area. Then it's likely that branch of the system has a clog someplace, if you see a big puddle where a storm drain need to be. In cases where the clog can not be found instantly we'll use our inspection electronic cameras to examine the storm drain system from the inside with a real-time camera feed.

Water will release till the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
