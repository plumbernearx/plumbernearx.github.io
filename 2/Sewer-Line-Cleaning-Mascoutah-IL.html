The concern can be a much deeper clog someplace in the main sewer line if the easy unclogging techniques do not work to fix the slow drain. Sadly, mainline blockages are normally much larger obstructions than require more than easy unclogging approaches, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Reducing or eliminating water solidity is made with a piece of equipment called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process happens. A softener is comprised of different components, each having their own distinct function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel generally built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is frequently referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most fundamental type has an electrical timer that recharges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>
