Popping sounds, for example, suggest that the water is boiling (which should never ever take place). Sediment accumulation or a defective thermostat represent common factors for boiling water.

They are non-testable and are generally used by public utility and set up after a water meter to avoid the meter from running in reverse and low defense against backflow.
