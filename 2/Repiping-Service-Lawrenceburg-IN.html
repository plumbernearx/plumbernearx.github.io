<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use a component that heats up water when the tap is switched on. The water is constantly heated up as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is instantly switched off, the water stops being heated up. The heating temperature level is typically pre-set to suit your preferences and needs. Due to the fact that they only heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
