Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water actually needs it. When needed, more recent systems utilize computerized sensing units that keep track of bead deficiency and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore only restore. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
