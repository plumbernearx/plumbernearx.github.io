A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hampering water flow. By setting up a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
