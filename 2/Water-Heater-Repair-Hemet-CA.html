<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk.
