Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water supply within a structure these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Water softeners leakages are mostly caused because of a concern at the point of installation or due to the fact that of maintenance.

If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed over time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration processes. A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely split and just needs to be changed.</p>
