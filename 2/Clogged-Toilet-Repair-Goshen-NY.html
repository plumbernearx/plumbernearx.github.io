Domestic water that shows up to your Ohio house brings minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and components.

The waste disposal unit is leaking from underneath your sink. Push the suggestion of a screwdriver up against the edge of the plug and tap until you break loose the plug. Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can most likely hold the unit upside down and shake it out).</p>
