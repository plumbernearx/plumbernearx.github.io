<p>This is a completely legitimate concern that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, naturally, as essential as your water heater, water line, or drains. Nonetheless, it adds a fair amount of performance to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a reasonably small round device installed under the kitchen drain.
