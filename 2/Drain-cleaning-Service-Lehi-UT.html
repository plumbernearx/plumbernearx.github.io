<p>For the purpose of water treatment, hardness is determined in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is specified as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one US gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is defined as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To transform between gpg and ppm use the list below factor; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm.
