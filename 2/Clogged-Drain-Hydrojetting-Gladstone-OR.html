<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never ever exactly matches supply.
