Making certain the brine tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the unit.

<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
