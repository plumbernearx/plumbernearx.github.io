<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is typically utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
