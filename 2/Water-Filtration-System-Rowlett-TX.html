<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the beginning of our home improvements. George and Anthony did a fantastic task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific requirements for our house. I will always utilize them and ask for George particularly for all future problems or repairs. They were prompt and offered great prices for what we required done. I highly advise this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation package includes a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>You should stress Whenever your drains are taking a long time to empty. Likewise be wary of drain-cleaning products-- they often do more damage than good. Merely call your local plumber for a professional evaluation. Time for a new garbage disposal? Give us a call for a FREE installation quote, or to arrange service.
