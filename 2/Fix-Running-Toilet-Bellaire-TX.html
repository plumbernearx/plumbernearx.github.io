<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the issue.

This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
