<p>A reduction in supply side pressure caused by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve permits the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Difficult water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing completely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the particles. Photos 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one common type of valve. Although other valves will look various, the clearing process is similar. Nevertheless, you might have to remove a few screws on top of the fill valve to get rid of the cap.</p>
