About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used during the backflush operation. What we mean is that your toilet is old. Older toilets may work simply fine, however if your toilet is really old (and outdated in style), you may wish to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing. Modern toilets are energy-efficient and conserve water when you flush, which not only is terrific for the environment, but it benefits your pocketbook as well. Plus, a brand-new toilet could make your bathroom remodel sizzle.</p>

Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mixture sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. You can repeat this process if it does not work the very first time. We do warm water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
