<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
