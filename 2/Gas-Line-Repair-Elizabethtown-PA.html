<p>Watering backflow devices are developed for installation on safe and clean water lines to secure versus both back-siphonage and back-pressure of contaminated water into the safe and clean supply of water.

The Supertech serviced our air conditioning unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain exactly what was incorrect with the unit, how he fixed the issue, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly recommend Hunter for any problems you may have.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
