<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
