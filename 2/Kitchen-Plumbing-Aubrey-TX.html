<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Aubrey TX</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
