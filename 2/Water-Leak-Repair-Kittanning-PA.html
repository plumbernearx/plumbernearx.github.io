Subsequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked annually. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need a yearly test.
