Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry.

This procedure continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about totally regrowed.</p>
