The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion.

Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to leave.

We need to look at each installation for the hazard it presents and after that install the appropriate security.</p>
