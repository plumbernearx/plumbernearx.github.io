<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has actually discovered prevalent usage considering that it avoids both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are set up in line with the pipeline and run independently of each other. A set of four test cocks enable the operator to analyze the valves and make certain they are not being forced open by collected particles.

In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any leftover contaminants.</p>
