If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. Schedule a quote as quickly as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
