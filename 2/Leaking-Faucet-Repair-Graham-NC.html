For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up requiring to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
