<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Once again, it is a good idea to check the manufacturer's guidelines for unique precautions.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is burst, it immediately ends up being a serious safety risk. Without being repaired as rapidly as possible, it might trigger a fair bit of damage if the gas inside becomes ignited.
