<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female thought the cost she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things in a different way might have saved her a lot of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
