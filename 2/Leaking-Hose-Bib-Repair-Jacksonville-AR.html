<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
