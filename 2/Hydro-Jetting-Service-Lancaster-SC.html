<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively be part of your task requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has an unfavorable charge, which brings in the positively charged minerals in the water (a process known as, ion exchange).

Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
