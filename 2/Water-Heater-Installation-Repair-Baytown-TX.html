<p>There are two kinds of water softeners, a salt based water softener and a salt-free water softener Salt based water softeners will provide you more of the slick" feeling in the shower and you will discover the soap developing more bubbles. Other advantages you will see consist of brighter colors in your clothing, lowered scale build-up on your showers and softer skin. For a cutoff switch where the backflow preventer lies downstream of the booster pump( s) - set at 20 psi.</p>
<p>A. We strongly suggest a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers obstruct any water from negative or back pressure in your irrigation system at shutdown from going into back into your water source, hence lowering the risk of contamination of your water source. Lots of towns require the use of an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You might wish to check with your local town prior to installing your irrigation system.</p>
