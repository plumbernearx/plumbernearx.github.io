<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested yearly. Likewise allows provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested annually to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
