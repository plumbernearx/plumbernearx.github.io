We set up a temporary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, however after a day of this we understood that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will remain clog-free for one month. If it clogs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!
