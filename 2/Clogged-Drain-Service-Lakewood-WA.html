<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device.

Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.
