<p>Replace what's exposed.

Although it's a huge task, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or utility  room is fairly uncomplicated, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

<p>A recently set up hot water heater must not produce odd sounds, but it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to heat the water.

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be tested annually. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked each year to guarantee the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
