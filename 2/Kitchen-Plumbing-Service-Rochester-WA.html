<p>Roto-Rooter was featured in the SyFy television show Ghost Hunters (2004-2016) as the 2 creators of TAPS work for Roto-Rooter as plumbers in the company's Providence, Rhode Island branch. There are segments featuring Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing specialists in their day jobs at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal examinations on the program. In addition, a Roto-Rooter van is displayed in the opening sector of each episode. For some homes, water softening is just part of the option. A water conditioner or neutralizer may be the solution if you have iron, chlorine, or other contaminant problems that affect the safety and quality of your drinking water.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be gotten rid of by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Once again, it is suggested to check the maker's instructions for special precautions.</p>
