<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
