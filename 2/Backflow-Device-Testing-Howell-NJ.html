<p>Backflow prevention devices are created to secure the general public water supply from cross-connections. A contemporary neighborhood water supply system is developed to ensure that water streams to homes and buildings under pressure. If there is a cross-connection between the water supply and a contaminated source, this neighborhood water network includes many users where there is a danger to public health. A cross-connection can take place where there is a pressure drop in the water pipe. This pressure drop causes a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the public water system.</p>

Toilet leakages around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
