<p>While the costs to repipe a home varies with each task and across the United States, it will generally cost $600 to $2,000 to repipe a single function (toilet, tub, and so on) and you can expect to pay anywhere from $4,000 to $15,000 for a complete piping system replacement. More serious cross-connection dangers may need a special kind of backflow preventer that can immediately release possibly contaminated water before it goes into the general public supply of water.
