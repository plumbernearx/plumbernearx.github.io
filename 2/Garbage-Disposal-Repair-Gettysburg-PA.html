<p>Tree roots can be a significant factor in impacted sewer lines. Tree roots grow in several instructions and can get very large triggering invasion of the lines underground.

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
