<p>According to the Contractors State License Board, It shall be considered un-lawful to install any water heating device without an inspection by the local authorities".

Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be checked regularly to ensure they are operating effectively. A visual check of air spaces is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be checked with effectively adjusted gauge devices.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
