<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions.

As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Tough water causes gray or white deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
