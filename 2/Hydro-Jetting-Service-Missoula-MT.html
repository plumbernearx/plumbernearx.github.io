<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures in Missoula MT</h3>

Call (866) 701-5306 to arrange an appointment. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly specified by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
<p>Those people in the industry know that cross-connection programs in many locations have vastly reduced the variety of reported incidents that occur within our water systems. This has at times resulted in individuals believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never really have been a problem in the very first place. This thinking can be both hazardous and disadvantageous. Backflow occurrences in water supply are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a lowered pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the threat it provides and after that install the proper defense.</p>
