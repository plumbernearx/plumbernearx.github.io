<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Raymond MS</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
