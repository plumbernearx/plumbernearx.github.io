<p>Trees and shrubs are a typical reason for sewer blockages to the home. Roots can grow into the smallest fracture or gap in your house's drain pipe, where they flourish in the nutrient abundant environment supplied by the sewer. Flat roofs generally have drains spaced out around their border. The drains are connected to vertical pipes that are usually connected to underground horizontal pipes linked to municipal storm sewers.

<p>To decrease the need of gas line repair, it is very important to understand the typical causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning appliances take place most frequently in the winter. This is due to the fact that houses are not properly aerated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to notify you of any potential gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
