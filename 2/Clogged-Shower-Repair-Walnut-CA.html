Age-- As we mentioned, a 10+ year old water heater is probably on its last legs.

Usually, the very first two numbers indicate the year of your water heater.</p>

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
