<p>A clogged pipe can also permit water to leak into a structure. This not only damages the structural stability of a building, but it can also let water in through the floorboards, causing them to weaken and stain gradually. If a clogged pipe is left ignored for too long, it might lead to flooding and stagnant water, which attracts and breeds mildew, mold, and unwanted insects-- all of which are severe health dangers.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate in time, they slowly begin to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>

<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to eliminate wastewater from websites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk contains the earliest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had replaceable and quickly removable segments, and allowed for cleaning.</p>

Single traps shall be set up, whenever possible, within five feet of the outside of outside walls. Some disposals are linked to the dishwasher, which enables self-cleaning.
