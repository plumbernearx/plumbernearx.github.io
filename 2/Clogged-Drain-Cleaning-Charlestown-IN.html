<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to organisation? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water in fact needs it. When needed, more recent units use computerized sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and therefore just restore. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
