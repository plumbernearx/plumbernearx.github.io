It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain in addition to avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.
