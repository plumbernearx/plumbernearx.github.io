The hardness minerals, calcium and magnesium are still present and being taken shape. You will no longer have the disadvantage to tough water, i.e., scaling, obstructing and etching of aerators while retaining the advantageous minerals. Likewise, since the minerals are not being pulled out of the water, you will not be reducing the pH, which can cause water to become acidic helping it to stay alkaline which is extremely useful for you and your home.</p>
