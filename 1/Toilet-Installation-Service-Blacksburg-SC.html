Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water hardness can be eliminated fairly quickly by utilizing an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange gadgets.

<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which may bring unclean water or other, harmful compounds into the public supply of water and personal plumbing. Backflow can occur in a number of situations that may draw water from places such as garden fountains, swimming pools, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
