Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes trigger poisoning, the Roman water had so much calcium in it that a layer of plaque avoided the water getting in touch with the lead itself. What often causes confusion is the large amount of proof of extensive lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had simple access to piped water, 19 a regrettable outcome of lead being utilized in pots and pans and as an additive to processed food and beverage (for instance as a preservative in white wine). 20 Roman lead pipe engravings offered information on the owner to prevent water theft.</p>
