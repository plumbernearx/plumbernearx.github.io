At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in.

<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses. As you house ages the water traveling through your pipes gathers more sediment. This is why repiping your house makes sense.
