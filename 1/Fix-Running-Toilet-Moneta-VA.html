<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
