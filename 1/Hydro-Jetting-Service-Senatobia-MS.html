Light-weight products and compact construction equipment decrease the cost of repair and lessen environmental damage.

<p>The double check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire protection market, developing a redundancy designed to guarantee that one check valve will continue to secure the city water system even if the other stops working. This assembly also enables the closure of one valve to lower the pressure differential throughout the other, creating a more reliable seal and preventing even small backflow leak.

Repiping now will offer you comfort and avoid bigger leakages down the road.</p>
