<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure utilized to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any leftover impurities.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
