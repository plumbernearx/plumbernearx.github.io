<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Galt CA</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream backwards into the city water lines since pressure is lost throughout these occasions.</p>
