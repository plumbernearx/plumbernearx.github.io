It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
