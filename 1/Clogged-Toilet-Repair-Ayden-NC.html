Lubricant does not help the assembly work any better, it is just there to help the specialist assemble the parts into the body without producing damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lube to assure the water supply is not contaminated. In most cases the best lube is water. The typical usage for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not present of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to wear or fail out earlier by drawing in dirt and debris or restricting the movement of the component.

We recommend setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to notify you of any prospective gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
