<p>Finally, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
