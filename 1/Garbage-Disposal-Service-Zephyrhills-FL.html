These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
