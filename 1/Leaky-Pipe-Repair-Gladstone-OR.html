The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to leave.
