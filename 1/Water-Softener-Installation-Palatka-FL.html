Your Sink Isn't Draining Pipes Correctly: A clogged sink is one of the first indications that you have problem on your hands.

<p>When a garbage disposal breaks, it is probably just a matter of time before your sink begins to clog, as you and other house members are most likely not utilized to ensuring that no obstructive food waste goes down your drain.
