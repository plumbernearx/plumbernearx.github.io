<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>

Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the drab gray caused by tough water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, fixing, changing and servicing our softener.
