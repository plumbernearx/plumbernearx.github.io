<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in York SC</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
