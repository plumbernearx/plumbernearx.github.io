<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they slowly begin to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you notice it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, affecting your water quality.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated every year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked every year to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
