<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
