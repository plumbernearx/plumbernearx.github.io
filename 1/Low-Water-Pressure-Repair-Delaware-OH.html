The system is based on pressure and must be set up a minimum of six inches of where the downstream will be. It can be placed on PVC pipes, but is not testable. When you are experiencing any kind of plumbing problem that you feel might require drain cleaning & repair services, then getting in touch with experts who can repair any plumbing problems in a quick and efficient  manner is always advised.</p>

All significant plumbing code bodies address defense against backflow in potable supply of water systems. All potential or existing cross connections must be safeguarded from backflow by the installation of a proper backflow prevention device.
