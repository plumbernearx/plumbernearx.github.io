<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to get rid of wastewater from websites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the oldest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily detachable and changeable segments, and enabled cleaning.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is a good idea to check the maker's instructions for unique precautions.</p>
