Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to escape.
