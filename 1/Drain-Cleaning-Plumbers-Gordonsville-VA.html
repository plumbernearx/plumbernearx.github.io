That's a term scientists use to describe highly pure water, because if it doesn't have some impurities in it, it will tend to leach other chemicals out of whatever container it is in. That might be okay, if your water is stored in glass, but if it's stored in plastic, then the water could be leaching plastic, and you could be drinking it.">

<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin has already been fouled. Again, it is recommended to inspect the producer's guidelines for unique preventative measures.</p>
