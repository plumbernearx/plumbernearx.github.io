Claims may be rejected because the basic HO-3 homeowners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended period of time." Call your insurance agent and confirm your protection. Double check with your representative to verify that your understanding is proper when you have actually checked out through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
