Try reducing the tee to see if the tailpiece is long enough. If it's not, you'll need to replace it with one that's somewhat longer.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention measures must be kept on-site at all times throughout construction. Temporary water will be enabled after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker need to be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser must be firmly connected to strong rebar or wooden stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is substantially complete is forbidden unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and right away evaluated to guarantee it is working.</p>
