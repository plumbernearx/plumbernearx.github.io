House owners are responsible for preserving, fixing, and replacing natural gas pipes that run from the energy's gas meter to the home's natural gas equipment. When the source of a gas leak or other issue is on a client's natural gas pipe or associated connections, repair expenses can be high.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
