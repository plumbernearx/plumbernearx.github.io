Your garbage disposal includes a. hex wrench that can be utilized to place into the opening situated at the bottom of the system. If you can't find this wrench, then attempt to place a broom plunger or deal with into the sink drain opening and try to turn the jammed flywheel. If it appears to be moving freely turn the unit back on (and do not forget to turn back on the circuit breaker if you don't it off) and see if the unit is working.</p>
