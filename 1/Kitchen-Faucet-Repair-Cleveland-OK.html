The pipes can become breakable, gradually, and may need replacement sooner than hoped.

Contact your state's licensing board to learn more.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
