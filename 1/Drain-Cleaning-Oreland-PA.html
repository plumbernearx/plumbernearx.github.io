There are sections featuring Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing service technicians in their day jobs at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal examinations on the program. In addition, a Roto-Rooter van is shown in the opening section of each episode. For some houses, water softening is only part of the service. If you have iron, chlorine, or other contaminant problems that impact the safety and quality of your drinking water, a water conditioner or neutralizer may be the service.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Again, it is advisable to examine the producer's guidelines for special preventative measures.</p>
