Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water really needs it. When needed, newer units use electronic sensors that keep track of bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore only restore. These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
