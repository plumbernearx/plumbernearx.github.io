Although it's a big task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, energy, or crawlspace  room is relatively uncomplicated, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets should definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
