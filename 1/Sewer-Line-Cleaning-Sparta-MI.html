No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. Then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security cautions initially!), if that doesn't do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust stains and it's readily available at the majority of hardware stores.</p>
