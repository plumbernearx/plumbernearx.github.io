<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I love to cook, I create a lot of dishes. We set up a momentary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for 1 month. If it obstructs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!  We are really delighted that we selected Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly use this company once again and once again in the future.</p>
