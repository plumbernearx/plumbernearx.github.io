Some of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working garbage disposal, or excessive food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will typically recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the seriousness of the situation. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells nasty, or is sluggish to drain.</p>

Clogged clog and drainage problems might begin as minor concerns but can quickly speed up into substantial problems. A clogged drain can even lead to sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and pricey repairs.</p>
