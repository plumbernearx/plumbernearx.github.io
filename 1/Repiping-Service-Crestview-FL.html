The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if needed, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
