<p>A few local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It might not be set up in any place where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not allow the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't allow the usage of a PVB at all, so contact your water supplier. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it ought to be installed in an area where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
<p>When the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has deteriorated in its performance listed below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers ought to just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if essential, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
