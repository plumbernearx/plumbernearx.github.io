<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous desired usages around your house.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regenerated. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Difficult water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>
