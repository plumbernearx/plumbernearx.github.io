<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female thought the price she paid for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a couple of things differently could have saved her a great deal of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure.

For this factor, the RPZ should be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and permit sufficient drainage.</p>
