In a separate drain pathway, small pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a bigger one underneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house.

Quickly and effectively getting rid of remaining potato peels, fruit skins and many other types of food waste, the disposal grinds everything into great particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into your house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
