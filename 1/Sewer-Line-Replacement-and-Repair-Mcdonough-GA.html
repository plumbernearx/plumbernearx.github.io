I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
