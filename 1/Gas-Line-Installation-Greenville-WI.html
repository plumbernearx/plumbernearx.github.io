Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
