<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly regenerated. As difficult water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions.
