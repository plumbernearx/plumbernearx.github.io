<p>Read your insurance policy completely if your polybutylene pipes have stopped working. Make sure you know what is covered and what is not covered. Lots of insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be rejected because the standard HO-3 property owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended period of time." Call your insurance coverage representative and confirm your coverage. Double check with your representative to verify that your understanding is appropriate as soon as you have read through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered.</p>

<p>Sinkholes don't only occur in your yard, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to find out quickly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running underneath your house's structure. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out underneath your home, a sinkhole will cause the foundation to move and establish fractures. In this case, you'll need skilled plumbers as well as foundation repair professionals. Water heater service is frequently neglected, but your water heater is among the most important pieces of technology in your home.
