<p>Need backflow prevention assemblies and assemblies within a property as described in the state required plumbing codes. The water providers normally do not have the ability to repeatedly examine every consumer's premises for cross-connections and backflow defense. Typically, this would include the water service connection to each dedicated fire protection system or watering piping system and the water service connection to each of the following kinds of properties: (1) premises with an auxiliary or recovered water supply; (2) commercial, medical, lab, marine or other centers where objectionable compounds are dealt with in such a way that could cause pollution or contamination of the public water system; (3) facilities exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and premises where an internal backflow prevention assembly required under the State Plumbing Code is not correctly installed or maintained; (4) categorized or restricted facilities; and (5) tall buildings.</p>
