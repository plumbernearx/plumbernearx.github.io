But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more.
