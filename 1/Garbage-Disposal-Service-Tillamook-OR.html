The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on.
