<p>A freshly installed water heater must not produce unusual sounds, but it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things intensify drastically for homes with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement may be needed if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed.</p>
