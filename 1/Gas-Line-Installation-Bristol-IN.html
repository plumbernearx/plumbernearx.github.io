<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
