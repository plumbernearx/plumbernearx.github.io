New meters should meet guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas service providers might need an unique meter for their services, restricting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the building authorization. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (before putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon conclusion.
