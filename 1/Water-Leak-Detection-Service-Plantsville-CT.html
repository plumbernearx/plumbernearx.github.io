<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Plantsville CT</h3>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the safe and clean supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be set up. An approved, correctly set up and maintained backflow assembly essentially removes the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the distinction is insufficient to make any considerable modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electrical option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
