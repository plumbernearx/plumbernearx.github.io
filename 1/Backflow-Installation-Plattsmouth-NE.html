<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
