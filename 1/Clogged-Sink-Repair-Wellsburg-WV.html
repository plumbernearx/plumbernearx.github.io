The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
