<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female thought the rate she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things in a different way could have saved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
