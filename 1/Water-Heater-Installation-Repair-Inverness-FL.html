They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention. The main distinction amongst water softener designs remains in the method they set up the backflush cycles. Because recharging the beads with salt too early wastes salt and water, this is crucial. Charging too late causes performance to fall off.</p>

<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>

The sodium uptake through softened water depends upon the solidity of the water. Averagely, less than 3% sodium uptake comes from consuming softened water.
