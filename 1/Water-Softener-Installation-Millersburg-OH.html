<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal.
