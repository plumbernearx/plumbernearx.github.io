<p>While the costs to repipe a house varies with each project and across the United States, it will usually cost $600 to $2,000 to repipe a single feature (toilet, tub, etc.) and you can expect to pay anywhere from $4,000 to $15,000 for a total piping system replacement. More severe cross-connection dangers might require an unique kind of backflow preventer that can automatically discharge possibly contaminated water before it goes into the general public water supply.
