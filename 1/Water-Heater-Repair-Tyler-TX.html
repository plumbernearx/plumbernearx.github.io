Worms for watering systems: Homeowners discovered parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground lawn sprinkler. Throughout a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The homeowner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his child.</p>

Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to link wires properly, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
