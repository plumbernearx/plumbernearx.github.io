<p>Regrow your softener with potassium chloride rather of sodium chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is offered at most stores that offer softener salt. A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less area since the softener's salt water tank nests within the salt tank. Clogged clog and drainage problems may begin as minor problems however can rapidly accelerate into substantial problems. A clogged drain can even lead to slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and costly repairs.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most home centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
