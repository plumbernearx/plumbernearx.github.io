<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.

In addition to standard hot water heater, we also install tankless hot water heater, and heatpump water heaters.</p>
