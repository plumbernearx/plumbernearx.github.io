<p>Natural Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is entirely odor-free. The egg smell associated with natural gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you must take to secure yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.

All leakages, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
