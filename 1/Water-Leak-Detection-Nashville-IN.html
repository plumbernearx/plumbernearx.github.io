<p>pressure vacuum breakers: These are typically utilized in plants, cooling towers, labs, laundries, pool, sprinkler system systems, and fire sprinkler systems. Pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve developed to close with the help of a spring when water circulation stops. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above air pressure, avoiding non-potable water from being siphoned back into the potable system. The assembly consists of resilient, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
<p>The other difference between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (hence the name)-- not all at once like a constant feed waste disposal unit.
