The paired check valves are organized in line with the pipeline and run individually of each other.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to permit water at expected operational pressure to flow through. Need to backflow occur, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
