<p>Polybutylene pipes were utilized in some homes roughly twenty to forty years earlier. These pipes very unreliable and prone to failure. The failure is an outcome of piping materials and fittings breaking down, but is incorrectly attributed to bad workmanship in a lot of cases. Some homeowners assume that since their piping has actually lasted some years without failure that it is not defective. Really, most polybutylene pipes last for up to twenty years prior to failing.</p>
<p>There are two very good factors to insist on a sewer camera inspection of your sanitary and storm sewer before purchasing. If your house that you have your eye on is an older home in a fully grown area you most likely have larger trees on or near the residential or commercial property.  Sadly where there are trees there are generally tree roots and they love to find water within your sewer. There is no other way of knowing whether or not you have a tree root problem without seeing it with a camera inspection. You can roll the dice and wait on the very first rainstorm but I believe you 'd rather not.</p>
