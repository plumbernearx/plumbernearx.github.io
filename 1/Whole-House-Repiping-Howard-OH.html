<p>Removing or minimizing water hardness is made with a tool referred to as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process takes place. A softener is consisted of various parts, each having their own special purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel normally built out of fiberglass.
