<p>Backflow preventers not adhering to these rules for a provided application and which are broken or broken and need replacement should be replaced by a backflow preventer which does comply to the guidelines for the offered application. A camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most efficient ways of locating the exact location of a plumbing issue. A plumber will place a specifically designed waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to identify where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
<p>If you find a leak and choose a patching job instead of a repiping job, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same product and they might be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
