<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
