Replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride may be suitable if health or ecological factors require limiting salt. In time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has three cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regeneration procedure can be scheduled immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
