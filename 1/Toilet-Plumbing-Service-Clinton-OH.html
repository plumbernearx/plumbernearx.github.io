<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future.

A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger.
