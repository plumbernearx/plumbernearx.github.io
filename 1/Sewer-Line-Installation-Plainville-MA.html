<p>Lubrication might assist with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is just there to help the specialist assemble the elements into the body without producing damage from friction.

The typical use for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly oiled to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using excessive lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or wear out faster by drawing in dirt and particles or limiting the movement of the component. The appropriate amount of lube must make the surface area of the 'ring appear damp. You need to never see chunks or globs of lube.</p>
