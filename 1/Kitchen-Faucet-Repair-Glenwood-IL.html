In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any leftover pollutants.</p>
