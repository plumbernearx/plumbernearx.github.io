<p>There are 2 popular install systems used for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt install (if you have actually had a disposer installed for some time, it's probably mounted in this manner) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock").
