Even if the system is off, the blades are harmful and sharp. Make certain the unit is off, you can even turn off the breaker to make certain it can't be switched on by accident. Your garbage disposal includes a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening located at the bottom of the system. Try to place a broom manage or plunger into the sink drain opening and try to turn the jammed flywheel if you can't locate this wrench.
