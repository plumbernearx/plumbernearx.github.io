<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>

As rust or minerals build up over time, they gradually begin to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
