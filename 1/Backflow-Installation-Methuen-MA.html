<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in lots of locations have greatly decreased the number of reported occurrences that take place within our water systems. This has at times resulted in people believing that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never actually have actually been a problem in the very first location. This thinking can be both detrimental and harmful. Backflow events in water systems are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a reduced pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or absolutely nothing technique to backflow protection. We need to look at each installation for the danger it provides and then install the correct defense.</p>

It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
