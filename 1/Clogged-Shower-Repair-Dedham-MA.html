<p>Lubrication might assist with the positioning of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the technician put together the parts into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant should be a food grade lubricant to assure the water system is not contaminated. In a lot of cases the best lube is water. The typical use for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of excessive lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out earlier by drawing in dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the element. The appropriate quantity of lube should make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You should never see portions or globs of lubricant.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To prevent this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation package includes a tube, or buy one individually at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Because they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are typically chosen. Other good options are overload protection, which shuts off the motor if it begins to overheat; an auto-reverse feature to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the filthy dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly developed to be utilized with a septic tank. gives a summary 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
