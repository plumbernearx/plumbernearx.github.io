<h3>Plumbing Services Around Conover NC</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
