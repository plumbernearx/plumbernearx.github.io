<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future.

Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
