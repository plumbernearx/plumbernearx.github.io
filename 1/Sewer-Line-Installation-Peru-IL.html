<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its numerous designated uses around your home.</p>

In a separate drain path, little pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a larger one below the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home.
