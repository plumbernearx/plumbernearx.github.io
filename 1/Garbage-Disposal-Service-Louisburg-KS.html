<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
