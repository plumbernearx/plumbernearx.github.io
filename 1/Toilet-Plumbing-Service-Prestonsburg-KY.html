<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

For most obstructions you'll simply need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this doesn't resolve the issue then you might also have to contact a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
