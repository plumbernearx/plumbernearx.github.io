<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Examine the directions if your valve is a various style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
<p>When it comes to drains, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of treatment. To put it simply, taking particular preventative measures and executing smart practices such as installing hair guards, just flushing soft, little food particles down your waste disposal unit, and never using your toilet or drain as a wastebasket can help you prevent many drain blockages and keep your plumbing running smoothly.
