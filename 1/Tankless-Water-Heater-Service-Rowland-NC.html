<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the safe and clean water supply and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed.

Well, first let's ask you a different question: How old is your home? If it was built prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not currently).

<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
