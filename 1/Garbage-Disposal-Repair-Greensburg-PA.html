<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet effectiveness- The greater the effectiveness of the toilet, the more it costs. The effectiveness of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Houses that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.
