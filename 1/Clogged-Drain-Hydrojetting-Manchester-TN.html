The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
