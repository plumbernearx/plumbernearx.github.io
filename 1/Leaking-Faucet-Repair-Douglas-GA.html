<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Douglas GA</h3>
<p>This is a completely legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, obviously, as crucial as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. Nonetheless, it adds a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively little round device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and certain other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the life time of some appliances. Water softening is usually accomplished using ion-exchange resins. The waste disposal unit is leaking from underneath your sink. Push the pointer of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap up until you break out the plug. Then remove this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can probably hold the unit upside down and shake it out).</p>
