<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically use a component that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly heated up as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being heated up.

Since they just heat water when needed, tankless electric water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
