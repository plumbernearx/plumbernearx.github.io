<p>Leaks are tricky.

<p>A common water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
