<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Backflow preventer installation costs differ based on the specific site conditions, the size and amount of the water service( s), and the proximity to a floor drain. For each device, the cost can vary from a base of $7,500 to $15,000 for midsize buildings and $15,000 to $35,000 for larger structures; this does not include the PE's or RA's style charges. The DEP filing cost is $350 per service connection and the DOB filing cost is a little over 1% of the approximated plumbing cost. The size of the device is also a factor in cost. For instance, a one-inch device can begin at $225, while a three-inch device might cost $2,800. Labor expenses also increase with pipe size.</p>

<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to open and discharge water to the exterior if either check valve should leak.

For this reason, the RPZ must be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
