Thankfully, there are lots of alternatives available for improving the taste of your water, along with for softening the water to specific home appliances or fixtures.</p>
<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, utility, or crawlspace  room is fairly straightforward, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
