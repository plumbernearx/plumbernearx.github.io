<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Cleves OH?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be constantly kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
