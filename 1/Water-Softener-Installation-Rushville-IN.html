Backflow is an issue because it can cause wastewater to recede into a house, polluting the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Turn on the water (cautiously, so you don't get a cold shower!) and let it eliminate the toilet valve for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>For beginners it will probably have trouble staying up to date with the flow of water and will start to flood the area. If you notice a large puddle where a storm drain should be then it's most likely that branch of the system has a clog somewhere. In cases where the clog can not be found instantly we'll use our inspection cams to inspect the storm drain system from the inside with a real-time camera feed. We'll be able to identify the exact place of the clog and what's triggering it.</p>
<p>In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.
