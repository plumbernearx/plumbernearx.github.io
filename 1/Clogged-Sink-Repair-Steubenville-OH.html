<p>Trees and shrubs are a typical cause of sewer clogs to the house. Roots can turn into the tiniest crack or space in your home's drain pipe, where they grow in the nutrient abundant environment offered by the sewer. Flat roofings generally have drains spaced out around their perimeter. The drains are linked to vertical pipes that are normally connected to underground horizontal pipes linked to community storm sewers. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to restore flow and prevent water collection on top of the building's roof.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
