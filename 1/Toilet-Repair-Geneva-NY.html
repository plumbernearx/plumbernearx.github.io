<p>Horseshoe Bay companies and homes may have several locations needing backflow preventers. Our most common applications in Horseshoe Bay are listed here. The system picked for a given installation must be appropriate for the system style and website conditions, including factor to consider of whether back siphoning or backpressure is likely to take place. Even more, it should be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, maker requirements, and engineering standards for the type of system to be utilized.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be checked every year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked yearly to insure the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
