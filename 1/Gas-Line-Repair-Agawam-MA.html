<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>

A clogged kitchen sink is usually a sign of a clog in the plumbing system. If the clog isn't gotten rid of, water pressure can develop within the pipe, ultimately causing it to burst. Weak or no flush: The failure to flush your toilet or needing to flush a number of times after one usage indicates it's time for a replacement.
