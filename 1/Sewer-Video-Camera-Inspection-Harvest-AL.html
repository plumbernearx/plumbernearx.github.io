<p>Backflow prevention steps must be preserved on-site at all times during building and construction. Short-term water will be enabled after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker must be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be firmly connected to strong rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is considerably complete is forbidden unless a check backflow assembly is installed and instantly tested to ensure it is working.</p>
