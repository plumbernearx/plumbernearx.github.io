<p>The law likewise needs annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report sent to the DEP. Failure to comply can cause penalties and termination of water service.

<p>Dual Examine Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is essentially a disrobed Double Check Valve without shut off valves and test dicks. They are non-testable and are typically used by public utility and set up after a water meter to avoid the meter from running backwards and low security versus backflow. This tool is the center of debate with many backflow authorities and need to never ever be puzzled with Check Valves. Talk to local authorities for required installation, as most do not acknowledge these as backflow prevention devices.</p>

They use a range of parts and gadgets that work together for the performance of a single sink. For example, a kitchen sink might involve as many as six separate systems just to provide the overall service we expect. Like any machine, a sink has several parts that need maintenance and repair in time. A plumbing license provides for three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections called in on work not completed, not properly set up, or on an inaccessible residential or commercial property will need re-inspection.
