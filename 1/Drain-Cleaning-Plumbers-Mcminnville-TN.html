<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
