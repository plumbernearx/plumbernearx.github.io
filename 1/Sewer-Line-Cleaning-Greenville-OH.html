About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is utilized throughout the backflush operation. What we indicate is that your toilet is old. Older toilets might work simply great, however if your toilet is really old (and dated in style), you may wish to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing. Modern toilets are energy-efficient and conserve water when you flush, which not only is great for the environment, but it's good for your wallet as well. Plus, a brand-new toilet could make your bathroom remodel sizzle.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is facilitated by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another combination that can deal with sink obstructions. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mixture sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the first time, you can repeat this process. We do hot water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
