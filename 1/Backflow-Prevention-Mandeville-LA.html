<p>The US Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs. As you home ages the water traveling through your pipes collects more sediment. This is why repiping your home makes good sense. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving.</p>

When water reverses flow in its plumbing pipes, Backflow is the term we utilize to describe. Your plumbing system is only created for water to move in one direction, but if there's an unexpected change in pressure inside the pipes, it can cause the water to flow the wrong way. Plumbers will also examine the toilets in the home. Running toilets signify a leaking seal inside of the toilet and if left unattended, can waste thousands of gallons of water each day.</p>
<p>Disc: Found in both kitchens and bathrooms, disc faucets are recognizable by a single lever which moves on a wide, cylindrical body.

After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new area and positioned there. So if your water heater needs repairs and you live in Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Williamsburg, Yorktown, Suffolk, Portsmouth, Tabb, Grafton, Smithfield, James City County, or Hampton Roadways, all you have to do is contact A-1 plumbers to repair it for you.
