<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
