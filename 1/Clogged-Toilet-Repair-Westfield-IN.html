<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
