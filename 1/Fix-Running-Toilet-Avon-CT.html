If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you need to take to protect yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
