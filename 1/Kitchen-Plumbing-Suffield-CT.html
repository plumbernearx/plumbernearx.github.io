<p>Run the hot water. Hot water is your friend, specifically for your kitchen sink. Even if you are extremely careful with what you put down your sinks, food residues and cooking oils still leave down our drains - specifically the kitchen sink. Running the warm water after you've used your sink helps clear particles and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear. Directing takes place when the incoming hard water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.
