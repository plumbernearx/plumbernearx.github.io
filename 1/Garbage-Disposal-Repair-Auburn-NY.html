No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force.
