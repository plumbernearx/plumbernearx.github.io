<p>Standard water softeners discovered in house supply and hardware shops will eliminate almost all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water during the softening procedure. Softeners also will get rid of up to 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water materials with high levels of iron and manganese (higher than 10 ppm) may need pretreatment to lengthen the life expectancy of a water softener. The impacts of a malfunctioning toilet vary greatly-- from the moderate annoyance of a tank that will not stop running to the unhygienic and potentially dreadful back-up of unflushed sewage.
