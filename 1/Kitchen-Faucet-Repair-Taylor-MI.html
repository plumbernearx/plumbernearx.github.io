<p>Normal causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root intrusion, obstructions (such as foreign items, toilet paper, grease, and other debris), deterioration, and broken seals or joints between areas of sewer line. Homeowners are responsible for keeping, fixing, and changing gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the home's gas equipment. When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a consumer's natural gas pipe or related connections, repair costs can be high.</p>
<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are a few of the most important functions of a company. Customers can leave your organisation with a negative impression if toilets and urinals don't operate appropriately. Leaking toilets cost money, damage commercial residential or commercial property, and causes hazardous slippery locations. Waste water is associated with possible health dangers, including unhygienic conditions and unpleasant smells. A clogged toilet can provide a poor experience for your consumers.</p>
<p>Over time, like any other appliance in your home, your garbage disposal. might need repairs. A disposal system might begin or clog to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, use.

But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
