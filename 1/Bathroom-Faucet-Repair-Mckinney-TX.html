After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Image 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Switch off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the issue.</p>
