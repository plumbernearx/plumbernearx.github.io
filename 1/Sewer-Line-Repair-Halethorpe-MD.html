With a hot water heater replacement, you'll resolve your repair issues, and have improved water heater efficiency too. The salt uptake through softened water depends on the firmness of the water. Averagely, less than 3% sodium uptake originates from drinking softened water. Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
