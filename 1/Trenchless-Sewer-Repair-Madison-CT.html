The usual usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be gently lubed to assure they do not present of their retainer. Using excessive lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to use or fail out sooner by attracting dirt and debris or limiting the movement of the element.
