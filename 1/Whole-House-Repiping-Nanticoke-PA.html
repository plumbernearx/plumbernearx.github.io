<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>While not every state needs insurance prior to contractor licenses are released, having your own assurances the security of your company. Unanticipated events and unfavorable situations may take place anytime and being unprepared can put your service in huge financial trouble.
