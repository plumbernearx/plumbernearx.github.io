If your showers become disappointing, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. Waters than contain other anions such as chloride or sulfate can not be remediated by boiling, and are said to be "completely" hard. The only useful treatment is to get rid of all the ions, usually by the approach described listed below.</p>

A set of four test cocks allow the operator to examine the valves and make sure they are not being required open by accumulated debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at awaited operational pressure to stream through. Must backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, preventing the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
