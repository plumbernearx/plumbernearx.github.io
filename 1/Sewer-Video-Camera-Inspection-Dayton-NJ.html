<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads end up being loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, difficult water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>

The drains are connected to vertical pipes that are usually connected to underground horizontal pipes linked to community storm sewers.
