<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
