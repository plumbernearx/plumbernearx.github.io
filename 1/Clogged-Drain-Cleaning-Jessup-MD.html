<p>Roto-Rooter was featured in the SyFy tv program Ghost Hunters (2004-2016) as the two founders of TAPS work for Roto-Rooter as plumbers in the company's Providence, Rhode Island branch. There are sectors featuring Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing specialists in their day jobs at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal investigations on the show. Additionally, a Roto-Rooter van is displayed in the opening segment of each episode. For some houses, water softening is just part of the solution.

The heating temperature level is usually pre-set to fit your requirements and preferences. Tankless electrical hot water heater use less power than traditional water heaters since they just heat water when needed.</p>
