<p>Roto-Rooter was featured in the SyFy tv program Ghost Hunters (2004-2016) as the two founders of TAPS work for Roto-Rooter as plumbers in the company's Providence, Rhode Island branch. There are sectors featuring Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing specialists in their day jobs at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal investigations on the show. Additionally, a Roto-Rooter van is displayed in the opening segment of each episode. For some houses, water softening is just part of the solution.

Tankless electrical hot water heater use less power than traditional water heaters since they just heat water when needed.</p>
