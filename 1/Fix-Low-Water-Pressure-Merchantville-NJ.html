<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Merchantville NJ</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
