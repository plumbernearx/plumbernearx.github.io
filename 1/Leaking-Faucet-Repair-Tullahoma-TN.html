<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
