A softener is comprised of different parts, each having their own special purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is typically described. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most standard type has an electric timer that flushes and charges the system on a regular schedule.</p>
