<p>Conductor piping, when entering a City mix sewer, should be caught, either individually or a single trap not to surpass 10 inches in size. These traps shall consist of a cleanout to grade. Single traps will be installed, whenever possible, within five feet of the outside of outside walls. Some disposals are linked to the dishwasher, which enables self-cleaning.

<p>To lower the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the typical reasons for gas leakages. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances take place most typically in the winter. This is because homes are not effectively ventilated throughout the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to signal you of any possible gas leakages if you haven't done so currently.</p>
