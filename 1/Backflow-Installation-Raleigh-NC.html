<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily saved for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
