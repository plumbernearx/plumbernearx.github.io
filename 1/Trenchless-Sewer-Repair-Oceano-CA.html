<p>Typical causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root invasion, blockages (such as foreign objects, bathroom tissue, grease, and other particles), wear and tear, and broken seals or joints in between areas of sewer line. Property owners are responsible for keeping, fixing, and replacing natural gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the home's gas devices.
