<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is generally utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and solidify or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the area in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape.</p>
