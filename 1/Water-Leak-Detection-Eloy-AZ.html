<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Eloy AZ</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>For beginners it will probably have problem staying up to date with the flow of water and will begin to flood the area.

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
