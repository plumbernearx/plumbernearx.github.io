<p>Electrolysis: This method uses what is essentially a battery.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>
