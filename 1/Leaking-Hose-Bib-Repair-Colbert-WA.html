<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
