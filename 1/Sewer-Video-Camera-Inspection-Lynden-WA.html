A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater. To guarantee that we are providing high-quality work and client comfort, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely carry out water heater replacements. In addition to traditional water heaters, we also install tankless water heaters, and heatpump hot water heater.</p>
<p>As toilets age, they need to work more difficult to do their jobs. More difficult work means more water.

If you're worried about your water costs, think about changing your old toilet with a modern low-flow design. The new low-flow toilets work simply as successfully as any other kind of toilet, and you'll conserve an unexpected quantity on your expense.</p>
