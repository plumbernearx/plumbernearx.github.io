<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
