<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to reduce these symptoms.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to damage micro-organisms and provide purified water. The energy source needed to warm the water is less expensive. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water hardness can be removed fairly easily by utilizing an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations describe favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
