I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
