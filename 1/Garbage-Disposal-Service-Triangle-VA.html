If you have not tested the softness of your water since the system has actually been installed, you may be shocked by the outcomes.</p>
<p>Electrolysis: This method utilizes what is basically a battery. Metal electrodes are immersed in the water and release positive zinc ions, which also launch electrons that move through the wire to the cathode. When the zinc anode liquifies, this process eventually ceases.

If you have not done so already, we recommend installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to inform you of any possible gas leaks.</p>
