<p>Obviously, it's constantly much easier to avoid obstructions in the very first location. If you have a kitchen waste disposal unit, don't overload it. Feed items in a little at a time, and wait up until they grind and run through completely before including more. Never put bacon grease, coffee premises or oils down your kitchen drain, and constantly make certain you run a lot of thin down the drain after each use. It is very important to know how to care and preserve for your all your house's plumbing parts and systems to keep things running smoothly.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
