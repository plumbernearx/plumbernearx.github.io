<p>Sluggish drains. A sluggish drain can be a typical plumbing problem, and a lot of obstructions can be fixed with an easy fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the basic unclogging methods do not work to resolve the sluggish drain, the problem can be a deeper obstruction somewhere in the main sewer line. Unfortunately, mainline obstructions are normally much bigger obstructions than need more than simple unclogging methods, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>

With time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon approximately helps remove the sediment. If your house has drain problems, it's time to call the pros from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing before your problem gets even worse. If there is black sludge appearing on the sink, erupting out from the drainage hole, call a plumber in Perkasie at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>The other difference in between constant feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (thus the name)-- not simultaneously like a constant feed waste disposal unit.

While gas leaks are unusual, you need to get out of the structure immediately if you notice an odor like rotten eggs in your home. A gas leak can have nearly instant effects on those exposed to it, and it can even be deadly. If you've got a gas pipe leaking, get out of the house and call us right away.</p>
