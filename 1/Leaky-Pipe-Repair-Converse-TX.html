<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
