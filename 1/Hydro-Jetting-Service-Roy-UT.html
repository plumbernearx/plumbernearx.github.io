Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions.

Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
