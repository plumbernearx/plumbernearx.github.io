<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or utility  room is fairly uncomplicated, since the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
