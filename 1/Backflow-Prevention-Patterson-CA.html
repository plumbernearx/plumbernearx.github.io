If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you ought to require to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.
