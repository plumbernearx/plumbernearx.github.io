<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Bixby OK</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>If you are in a position that you observe the indications of a gas line leak, the most important thing to do is to get out of your home as soon as possible.

Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
