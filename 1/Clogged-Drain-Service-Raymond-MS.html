The drip pan is set up under the water heater in order to gather any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the home or into a suitable drain.

<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Raymond MS</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous designated uses around your house.</p>
<p>With drain line cleaning, you know your pipes are sparkly clean. With repairs, you know they remain in good condition. And with lining, you know they'll be safe and secure for many years to come. As a house owner or business owner, those reassurances can be very, very great to hear. We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond.
