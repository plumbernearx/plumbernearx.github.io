An approved, effectively installed and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity.

<p>Cooking oil and other greases need to never ever be put down the garbage disposal since they can impede the blades.
