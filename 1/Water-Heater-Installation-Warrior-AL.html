<p>Regular causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root intrusion, obstructions (such as foreign things, bathroom tissue, grease, and other particles), wear and tear, and broken seals or joints between areas of sewer line. Homeowners are responsible for keeping, repairing, and changing natural gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the home's natural gas devices. When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a client's gas pipe or associated connections, repair expenses can be high.</p>

Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with warm water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water appliances? This is an excellent sign that your pipes may be rusting from the within and for that reason, need to be replaced. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water just features hot water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
