In a different drain path, little pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet a bigger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home.

Quickly and effectively removing remaining potato peels, fruit rinds and lots of other types of food waste, the disposal grinds everything into fine particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
