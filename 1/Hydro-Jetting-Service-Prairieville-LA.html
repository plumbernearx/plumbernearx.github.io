<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
