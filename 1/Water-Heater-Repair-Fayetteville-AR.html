<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes.

The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high risk" establishments.</p>
