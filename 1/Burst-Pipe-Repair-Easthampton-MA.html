<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
