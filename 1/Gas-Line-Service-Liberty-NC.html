<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regrowth depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water actually requires it. More recent units utilize computerized sensors that monitor bead deficiency and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regrow when required. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
