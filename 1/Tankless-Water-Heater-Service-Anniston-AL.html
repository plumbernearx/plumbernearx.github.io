<p>Sluggish drains. A slow drain can be a typical plumbing issue, and many blockages can be fixed with a simple fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the basic unclogging methods do not work to resolve the slow drain, the issue can be a deeper blockage someplace in the main sewer line. Unfortunately, mainline clogs are usually much larger obstructions than require more than easy unclogging methods, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Minimizing or removing water firmness is made with a tool called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process occurs. A softener is comprised of various components, each having their own unique purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel typically constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is typically referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electrical timer that flushes and recharges the system on a routine schedule.</p>
