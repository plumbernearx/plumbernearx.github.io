<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the approach laid out above. Because the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is particularly true when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
