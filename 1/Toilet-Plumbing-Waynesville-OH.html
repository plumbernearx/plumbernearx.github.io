<p>The term difficult water describes water with a high mineral content. These minerals can vary depending upon which area of the country you remain in, but a lot of commonly include calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Difficult water does not start out hard-- instead, it picks up mineral deposits as it can be found in contact with limestone underground.

Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
