<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best 1st experience with the beginning of our house enhancements. George and Anthony did a remarkable job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They likewise worked around our specific requirements for our home.

Waste disposal unit warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can range in between 2 and ten years. Given that the typical life-span of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may wish to purchase a prolonged guarantee. A lot of warranties cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures.
