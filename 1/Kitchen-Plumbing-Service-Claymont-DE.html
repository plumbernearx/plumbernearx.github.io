Waste disposal unit warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can range in between 2 and ten years. Given that the typical life-span of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may wish to purchase a prolonged guarantee. A lot of warranties cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures.
