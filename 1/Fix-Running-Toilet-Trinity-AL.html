<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable water supply and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An authorized, properly set up and maintained backflow assembly essentially removes the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity. Still, the difference is inadequate to make any substantial changes in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electrical option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
