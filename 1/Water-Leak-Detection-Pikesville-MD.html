When one immediately begins regeneration after including salt to the reservoir, the water softener may not work according to requirements. After an approval of strategies has actually been released and the assembly has been installed, it should be evaluated by a certified tester. The designer (or water supplier) is then responsible to license that the installation was performed in accordance with authorized plans; or describe any changes or submit "As Built" plans as appropriate.</p>

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style).

This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
