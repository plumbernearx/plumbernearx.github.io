<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You may need to look into using a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
