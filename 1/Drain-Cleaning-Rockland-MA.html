Basements and utility rooms include some of a home's most important and regularly utilized residential plumbing components. Roto-Rooter's expert plumbers supply a complete variety of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning services, but basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most common. To prep your unit for installation, you may need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
