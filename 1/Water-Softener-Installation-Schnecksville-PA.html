<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to company? The timing of regeneration depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water really requires it. When needed, more recent systems utilize digital sensors that keep track of bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only restore. These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
