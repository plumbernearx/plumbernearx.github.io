<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads become filled with salt ions from the water softener salt.

The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these symptoms.</p>
