<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
