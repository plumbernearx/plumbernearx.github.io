<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in many locations have significantly lowered the number of reported events that happen within our water supply. This has at times led to individuals believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever really have been a problem in the first location. This thinking can be both detrimental and harmful. Backflow incidents in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a reduced pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing technique to backflow protection. We need to look at each installation for the danger it presents and then install the appropriate defense.</p>

You ought to also know that other than for cosmetically covering a chip in the porcelain and sealing around the joint, there's very little to repair on the sink itself; a problem will imply a sink replacement.</p>
