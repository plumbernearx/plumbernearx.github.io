<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested every year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated every year to guarantee the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
