Plumbers charge $45 to $150 an hour for gas line sets up or repairs.

<p>A leaking toilet is another common issue house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than most likely means your toilet has a leak. This problem is often triggered by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn out flapper valve. A drip pan is efficient and inexpensive. The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into an appropriate drain. An ideal time to replace or install a drip pan is when the water heater is being replaced.</p>

About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used during the backflush operation. What we suggest is that your toilet is old. Older toilets may work just fine, however if your toilet is actually old (and outdated in design), you might wish to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.
