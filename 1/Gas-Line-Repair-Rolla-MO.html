<p>A leaking toilet is another common issue house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than most likely means your toilet has a leak. This problem is often triggered by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn out flapper valve. A drip pan is efficient and inexpensive. The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into an appropriate drain. An ideal time to replace or install a drip pan is when the water heater is being replaced.</p>
