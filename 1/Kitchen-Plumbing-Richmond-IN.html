<h3>Plumbing Services Around Richmond IN</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
