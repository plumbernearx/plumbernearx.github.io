<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience blockages in multiple drains at once in your house, then that normally means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in numerous locations and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine.

Some do not permit the use of a PVB at all, so talk to your water supplier. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it should be set up in a location where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
