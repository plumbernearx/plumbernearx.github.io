<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if required, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store.

Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
