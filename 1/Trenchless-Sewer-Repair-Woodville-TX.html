From brand-new bathroom fixtures to custom countertops, we truly have it all. Our inventory makes us the best plumbing company for any job in Seattle, WA.

<p>A water hardness test would not show a lowered solidity. How do I understand it's working? The FutureSoft is a salt-free system that does not pull out the firmness to replace them with sodium. The hardness minerals, calcium and magnesium are still present and being taken shape. You will no longer have the drawback to tough water, i.e., scaling, etching and blocking of aerators while maintaining the advantageous minerals. Also, given that the minerals are not being pulled out of the water, you will not be reducing the pH, which can cause water to end up being acidic helping it to stay alkaline which is very helpful for you and your home.</p>
